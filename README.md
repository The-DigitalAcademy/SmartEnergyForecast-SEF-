PROBLEM STATEMENT

The energy sector in South Africa is facing challenges in managing power
security and planning for capacity generation due to a lack of accurate
forecasting of electricity demand, which is influenced by various factors such
as economic growth, population growth, climate conditions, and changes in
consumer behavior. This has resulted in power shortages and blackouts,
highlighting the urgent need for accurate electricity demand forecasting to
ensure reliable and sustainable electricity supply for the country's growing
population and economy.

THE SOLUTION

We will use machine learning to develop short-term and long-term forecasting
models that can accurately predict electricity demand and electricity loss by
analyzing historical data on electricity consumption patterns, weather
patterns, and demographic trends. These models can help utility companies
and policymakers to effectively manage power security, plan for capacity
generation, and identify areas where energy efficiency improvements can be
made to reduce demand. Short-term forecasting models can also help to
manage the supply and demand of electricity in real-time and avoid blackouts
or brownouts. Machine learning will be able to help us ensure a reliable and
secure supply of electricity for the future.
